# HSŁ stroboscope
A project for New Year's Eve. Badly scaled logo of HSŁ flickering in random colors. Really just few lines of C code + SDL boilerplate.

Flicker rate (fps) changes every frame so it is less predictable.

User can change image by pressing Space key. There are 3 images: HSŁ logo, DJ Cioran logo (who is also a member of our space) and "Zakaz umierania !!!" ("Dying prohibited !!!"). If you want to change images or their order, change the code and recompile (suckless way!!).

User can close program by pressing Escape key.

## Compiling
1. Install SDL2
2. `make`

## To do
1. idk
