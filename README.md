# HSŁ stroboscope
A project for New Year's Eve. Badly scaled logo of HSŁ flickering in random colors. Really just few lines of C code + SDL boilerplate.

Flicker rate (fps) changes every frame so it is less predictable.

Change images by pressing Space (next image) or pressing 1-3 keys.
Images:
1. badly scaled logo of HSŁ
2. DJ Cioran logo
3. Zakaz umierania !!!

Close program by pressing Escape key.

## Compiling
1. Install SDL2
2. `make`

## To do
1. idk
