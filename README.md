# HSŁ stroboscope
A project for New Year's Eve. Badly scaled logo of HSŁ flickering in random colors. Really just 5 lines of C code + SDL boilerplate
## Compiling
1. Install SDL2
2. `make`
## To do
1. Maybe add some keyboard shortcut for quitting. Now I'm using i3 so I can just close it with a keyboard shortcut, but on other systems/window managers it couldn't be done.
