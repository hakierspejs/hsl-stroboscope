# HSŁ stroboscope
A project for New Year's Eve. Badly scaled logo of HSŁ flickering in random colors. Really just few lines of C code + SDL boilerplate.
Flicker rate (fps) changes every frame so it is less predictable.
User can change image by pressing any key. There are 3 images: HSŁ logo, DJ Cioran logo (who is also a member of our space) and "Zakaz umierania !!!" ("Dying prohibited !!!"). If you want to change images or their order, change the code and recompile (suckless way!!).

## Compiling
1. Install SDL2
2. `make`
## To do
1. Maybe add some keyboard shortcut for quitting. Now I'm using i3 so I can just close it with a keyboard shortcut, but on other systems/window managers it couldn't be done.
